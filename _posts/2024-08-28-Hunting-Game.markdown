description:  I developed a hunting game where players track and hunt animals in a natural environment. The animals follow simple routines, such as feeding, drinking, and resting, and move between different areas to meet these needs. They have basic sensory abilities, like sight and sound, which allow them to detect the player's presence. Depending on the type of animal, their reactions vary; predators might chase the player, while prey will flee if they sense danger. The game emphasizes straightforward, realistic animal behaviors to create an engaging hunting experience.
