description: For my Undergraduate Thesis Project, I explored the application of Generative Pre-Trained Transformers (GPTs) in video game AI, specifically focusing on enhancing NPC behavior and dialogue generation. The research demonstrated how GPTs could be utilized to create more dynamic and contextually appropriate interactions within a game environment. This implementation showcased the potential of GPTs to improve the realism and immersion of player experiences through advanced AI-driven communication.
